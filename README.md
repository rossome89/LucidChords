# LucidChords

## About
I got annoyed with website listing songs I wanted to play through across 5+ pages because the websites were seemingly built for vertical screens. I'd be playing along with a song and then I'd hit the space bar just to all of a sudden skip several lines of the song or hit an ad or something so I made LucidChords in order for me to drag and drop lyrics/chords into a webpage and have it format it nicely. It seems to work fine locally on my machine so you shouldn't need to set up a web server to use it, just open the page in your browser.

I've only really tested this with Chrome, so I've got no idea how well it runs in other browsers.

## Tips
-Press F11 on most browsers to make it full screen.
