# LucidChords

## About
I got annoyed with website listing songs I wanted to play through across 5+ pages because the websites were seemingly built for vertical screens. I'd be playing along with a song and then I'd hit the space bar just to all of a sudden skip several lines of the song or hit an ad or something so I made LucidChords in order for me to upload lyrics/chords into a webpage and have it format it nicely. It seems to work fine locally on my machine so you shouldn't need to set up a web server to use it, just open the page in your browser and then load .txt files with lyrics and chords. The beauty of this is that you can change the .txt files to suit your needs and it's so incredibly lightweight that you'll never need to worry about an advert popping up over your screen while you're playing. You can also left-click anywhere on the screen to toggle between two columns or three if you're playing along with particularly wordy music.

I've only really tested this with Chrome, so I've got no idea how well it runs in other browsers.

## Tips
-Press F11 on most browsers to make it full screen.
-It respects whitespace so make sure you preserve it.
-Sometimes pages don't sit just right so add a few returns in the .txt to break up lines that shouldn't be together.
-I've just made a directory on my computer where I collect .txt files. [Click here for my example.](../master/ExamplePictures/Directory.png)

## To Do

~~-Add the ability to switch between 2 Columns or 3 Columns without changing any code - Single click on screen to toggle?~~
